Investigation Steps / Questions:


✅ SQL queries for each investigation step

1.1 Identify where and when the crime happened

Query:

SELECT evidence_id,
       room,
       description,
       found_time
FROM   evidence
WHERE  TRUNC(found_time) = DATE '2025-10-15'
ORDER  BY found_time;

1.2 Query:

SELECT room,
       COUNT(*) AS evidence_count
FROM   evidence
WHERE  TRUNC(found_time) = DATE '2025-10-15'
GROUP  BY room
ORDER  BY evidence_count DESC;

1.3 Query:

SELECT room,
       MIN(found_time) AS earliest_evidence_time
FROM   evidence
WHERE  TRUNC(found_time) = DATE '2025-10-15'
GROUP  BY room
ORDER  BY earliest_evidence_time;

2. Analyze who accessed critical areas at the time

Query:

       kl.employee_id,
       e.name,
       e.department,
       e.role,
       kl.room,
       kl.entry_time,
       kl.exit_time
FROM   keycard_logs kl
JOIN   employees e
       ON kl.employee_id = e.employee_id
WHERE  kl.room = 'CEO Office'
  AND  kl.entry_time BETWEEN
          TIMESTAMP '2025-10-15 20:30:00'
      AND TIMESTAMP '2025-10-15 21:10:00'

🕒 A short explanation of how you arrived at the conclusion

Evidence (evidence) is used to determine the crime date, main room, and approximate time of the murder.

Access logs (keycard_logs) show who entered the CEO Office around that time.

Alibis (alibis) are compared with actual access logs to find employees whose claimed location doesn’t match their keycard movements.

Call records (calls) identify people making or receiving calls around 20:50–21:00, close to the murder time.

Using INTERSECT, we find the single employee who:

Was in the CEO Office during the crime window,

Lied about their location (false alibi),

And was involved in calls around the critical time.

That employee’s name from employees.name is returned as the killer.
