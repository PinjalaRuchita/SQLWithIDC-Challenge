SQL QUERY:


OUTPUT:


🧠 What I Learned Today:

INNER JOIN retrieves only matching rows** from both tables

Understood relationships** between tables like patients, staff, and services

Learned to use table aliases (p, s, sw)** for cleaner queries

Practiced multi-table joins** with ON + multiple join conditions

Got clarity on WHERE vs ON in joins

Explored grouping and counting staff per service

🧩 Summary

Today’s challenge strengthened my understanding of:

How INNER JOIN works

 How to combine data from multiple tables
 
 How to avoid ambiguity using aliases
 
 Real-world joining of patient, staff, and service data

A solid foundation for building *analytical reports* in SQL!
