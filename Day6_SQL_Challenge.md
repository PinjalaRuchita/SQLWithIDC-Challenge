📘 Day 6 (09/11): GROUP BY Clause

🧭 Daily Challenge

Question: For each hospital service, calculate the total number of patients admitted, total patients refused, and the admission rate (percentage of requests that were admitted). Order by admission rate descending.

Query:

SELECT service, COUNT(patients_admitted) AS patients_admitted, COUNT(patients_refused) AS patients_refused, ROUND( (COUNT(patients_admitted) * 100.0) / (COUNT(patients_admitted) + COUNT(patients_refused)), 2 ) AS admission_rate FROM services_weekly GROUP BY service ORDER BY admission_rate DESC;

💻 Topics Covered:

GROUP BY — Aggregating rows by categories

🧩 Concept Overview

The GROUP BY clause divides rows into groups based on column values and applies aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) to each group.

🔹 Key Points

Every non-aggregated column in SELECT must appear in GROUP BY

Each group produces one result row

Use WHERE before GROUP BY, and HAVING after it

💡 Tips & Tricks

Think “one row per group”

Execution order: FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → SELECT → ORDER BY

Use GROUP BY service, month for combined grouping

You can ORDER BY aggregated columns

Alias aggregates for readability

🌱 What I Learned Today

Learned how GROUP BY aggregates data into categories.

Understood the difference between row-wise and group-wise aggregations.

Calculated percentages using aggregate functions.

Practiced real-world queries like finding admission rates by service.
